# Simple Statistics

A repository of simple Python scripts for various stats functions.
Mostly the product of my journey through HackerRank's [10 Days of Statistics](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-statistics).

You might find some of these covered in more detail on my [blog](https://vickylai.com/), but you can always reach out with questions via Twitter [@vickylaixy](https://twitter.com/vickylaixy).
